# 14-mini-standard-library python-games

A collection of 12 mini games created with standard library that scales in complexity. Good for beginners looking for examples of games that implement a specific python code.

I have done some 'notes' to explain the more complicated code but if you do not understand something best thing to do is to google it. I have also added a couple of bonus games that doesn't fit within the collection for additional examples and reference.  

A) Dice with Death = Simple dice game with death, you win you live. You lose, your soul is his. This is a very basic game using USER-DEFINED and IN BUILT functions/methods, also demonstrate 'IMPORT' from 'RANDOM' module.   

B) Hacker= Goal of the game is to hack into Robert's account. The more attempts, the more clues it provide. Implement the use of INPUT function and WHILE loop.

C) The lord, the hunter and the fox= alternative to Rock,Paper,Scissors. Using LIST data type and IF,ELIF and ELSE STATEMENTS.

D) Mini gamble = A simple 'Shell' game where you make bets on which pot the stone is under. Implement INT function converting 'string' to integer as well as BREAK statement. 

E) Battle Master= Build the optimal army to defeat the dreaded orcs. Demonstrate how to use GLOBAL Function to interact with global variable within a function. Implement the use of TRY and EXCEPT statements

F) Blood Pit= Fight a selection of monsters in the blood pit to gain reputation and glory. Demonstrate how to use data structure (LIST) to interact with global variable within a function. Demonstrate a user defined function with multiple arguments.  

G) Dungeon Hack  = an adventure simulation game. You need to pick a band of adventurers and complete a dungeon run. Depending on the combination of adventurers it will dictate the outcome of the dungeon run. Using FOR LOOP.

H) The Haunted House= A mini adventure game. Your main goal is to escape the house with the loot. Using NESTED DICTIONARY data type. 

I) A Grot's Life = A Survival crafting Game written in standard library where you play as a grot doing what a grot do. Version implements OOP Object oriented programming whilst Version B also implements 'IMPORT' transfering functions/class/lists from USER DEFINED modules (MODULARITY). Using CLASS is the best method to interact with global variables.

J) The Slumber of the Doom King= Break into the Doom King's castle and steal as much gold as possible and find an escape before the king consumes your soul. Using DICTIONARY and RETURN function. 

K) One Click RPG= An Idle RPG. Using TUPLES data type, TKINTER GUI library and INHERITANCE CLASS  

L) Space Rescue = Rescue the red ships and avoid the rocks. Using TURTLE GRAPHICS library and INHERITANCE CLASS.  

Bonus games 

The King's Curse = A simple text based adventure using Ascii graphics taken from  https://www.asciiart.eu/

The Road To Eden = Make hard decisions as you make your way to the city of Eden. Demonstrate how to read from txt files.
